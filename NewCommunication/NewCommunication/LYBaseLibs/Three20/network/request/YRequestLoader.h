/**
 * The loader manages a set of TTURLRequests and makes the necessary callbacks for each.
 * It implements the NSURLConnectionDelegate protocol and calls the required operations on the
 * queue as the protocol methods are invoked.
 *
 * NSURLErrorCannotFindHost errors are retried at least twice before completely giving up.
 *
 * The loader collects identical GET TTURLRequests into a single object. This logic is handled in
 * TTURLRequestQueue's sendRequest.
 * For all other TTURLRequest types, they will each have their own loader.
